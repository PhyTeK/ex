/*
  Exercise: Write a program called u1 that get two row arguments that
  are the numbers of rows anc columns of 2D array.
  
  1) Allocate dynamically memory to an array of int called arr.
  2) Initialize each element with the value of the sum of the 
     specific row with the specific column. (i+j)
  3) Print the resulting matrix on the screen (stdout).
  4) Print the resulting matrix to a file called file1
  5) Declare a function init.
  6) Define the function init that initialize arr with the elements (i+j)
